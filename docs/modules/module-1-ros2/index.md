# Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals

## Introduction to Robot Operating System 2

Welcome to Module 1, where you'll learn the fundamentals of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2). ROS 2 is the backbone of modern robotics development, providing a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's designed to support the development of complex, distributed robotic systems.

### What is ROS 2?

ROS 2 is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. It provides hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more. ROS 2 is the successor to ROS 1, designed to address the needs of commercial and real-world applications.

### Key Features of ROS 2

- **Distributed computing**: Multiple processes can communicate seamlessly
- **Real-time support**: For time-critical applications
- **Multi-language support**: C++, Python, and other languages
- **Improved security**: Built-in security features
- **Quality of Service (QoS)**: Configurable communication behavior
- **ROS 1 bridge**: Compatibility with existing ROS 1 packages

### Why Learn ROS 2?

ROS 2 is the de facto standard for robotics development in both academia and industry. Major robotics companies, research institutions, and robot manufacturers use ROS 2 for their development. Learning ROS 2 will enable you to:

- Work with a wide variety of robots and sensors
- Leverage a large ecosystem of existing packages
- Collaborate effectively with other roboticists
- Build on existing solutions rather than starting from scratch

### Module Structure

This module is organized into several key topics:

1. **Nodes, Topics, and Services**: The fundamental communication patterns
2. **rclpy**: Python client library for ROS 2
3. **URDF**: Unified Robot Description Format for robot modeling
4. **Practical Exercises**: Hands-on applications of concepts

Each section includes theoretical concepts followed by practical examples to reinforce your understanding.

### Learning Objectives for this Module

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture
- Create and run ROS 2 nodes in Python
- Implement communication between nodes using topics and services
- Use rclpy to develop ROS 2 applications
- Define basic robot models using URDF

Let's begin with the fundamental building blocks of ROS 2: nodes, topics, and services.
