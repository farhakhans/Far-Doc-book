# Assessments Overview

## Assessment Structure

The Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course includes multiple assessment types designed to evaluate both theoretical understanding and practical implementation skills:

### Continuous Assessment (60%)
- **Weekly Assignments**: 30%
- **Practical Exercises**: 20%
- **Project Milestones**: 10%

### Capstone Assessment (40%)
- **Mid-term Project**: 15%
- **Final Capstone Project**: 25%

## Assessment Philosophy

Our assessment approach emphasizes:
- **Practical Application**: Real-world implementation of concepts
- **Iterative Development**: Continuous improvement through feedback
- **Multimodal Integration**: Assessment of integrated systems
- **Safety and Ethics**: Responsible robotics development

## Learning Outcome Alignment

Each assessment directly aligns with specific learning outcomes:

| Assessment | LO-001 | LO-002 | LO-003 | LO-004 | LO-005 | LO-006 |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Weekly Assignments | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Practical Exercises | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Mid-term Project | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Final Capstone | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

## Grading Scale

- **A (90-100%)**: Exceptional work demonstrating mastery of concepts and innovative application
- **B (80-89%)**: Good work showing solid understanding and competent implementation
- **C (70-79%)**: Adequate work meeting basic requirements with some understanding
- **D (60-69%)**: Below expectations with significant gaps in understanding
- **F (Below 60%)**: Inadequate work failing to meet course requirements

## Academic Integrity

All assessments must represent your own work. Collaboration is encouraged for learning, but individual submissions must be your own implementation. Proper attribution must be given for any external resources used.

## Submission Guidelines

- All code submissions must include proper documentation
- Reports should follow the provided templates
- Demonstrations should be recorded when possible
- Late submissions may be penalized unless prior arrangements are made

## Feedback and Improvement

Constructive feedback will be provided for all assessments to support continuous learning and improvement. Students are encouraged to iterate on their work based on feedback received.
