- Deploy systems that safely interact with humans and environments
- Evaluate system performance using appropriate metrics
- Document and present technical solutions effectively

## Assessment Alignment

Each learning outcome is assessed through:

- **LO-001**: Written examination and concept mapping exercises
- **LO-002**: ROS 2 project implementing communication patterns
- **LO-003**: Simulation project with physics-based validation
- **LO-004**: Isaac platform project with navigation capabilities
- **LO-005**: Capstone VLA system with voice control
- **LO-006**: Final capstone demonstration and documentation

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this course, students should have:
- Basic programming experience (preferably in Python)
- Understanding of fundamental AI/ML concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Basic knowledge of physics and kinematics (helpful but not required)

These learning outcomes align with the progressive learning architecture of this course, building from foundational concepts to advanced integrated systems. Each outcome includes measurable criteria for assessment and connects to specific modules and practical exercises throughout the quarter.
