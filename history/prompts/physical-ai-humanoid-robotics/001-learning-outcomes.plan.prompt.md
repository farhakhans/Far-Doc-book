# Learning Outcomes Planning for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book

## Original Prompt

```
learning-outcomes
```

## Response

Successfully created comprehensive planning documentation for the learning outcomes of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. The implementation includes:

1. **plan.md**: Detailed implementation plan with technical context, constitution check, project structure, and learning outcomes
2. **research.md**: Research findings on technology stack, educational structure, and best practices
3. **data-model.md**: Comprehensive data model for the book's content and assessment structures
4. **quickstart.md**: Quickstart guide for contributors and educators
5. **contracts/**: API contracts for learning outcomes management
6. **learning-outcomes-summary.md**: Detailed summary of how each learning outcome is addressed throughout the curriculum

The learning outcomes (LO-001 through LO-006) are fully defined and integrated into the curriculum structure:
- LO-001: Understand Physical AI Fundamentals
- LO-002: Implement ROS 2 Communication Patterns
- LO-003: Design Simulation-Based Testing Environments
- LO-004: Utilize NVIDIA Isaac Platform Tools
- LO-005: Create Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems
- LO-006: Integrate and Deploy Complete Physical AI Systems

Each learning outcome has defined assessment methods, achievement indicators, and is mapped to specific modules and weeks in the 13-week academic quarter structure.
