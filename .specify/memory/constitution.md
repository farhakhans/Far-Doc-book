# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Physical AI & Embodied Intelligence Focus
Physical AI Systems and Embodied Intelligence form the core of this educational material. All content must bridge the gap between digital AI algorithms and their physical manifestation in humanoid robotics. Every chapter, example, and exercise must connect theoretical AI concepts to practical physical robot control and interaction.

### II. Open-Source Educational Excellence
Adherence to open-source tools and platforms is mandatory. All examples must use ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity, NVIDIA Isaac, or other approved open-source frameworks. Content must be accessible, well-documented, and reproducible by students with standard hardware configurations. Proprietary solutions may only be referenced with proper citations and open-source alternatives provided.

### III. Practical Application Over Theory (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Every concept must include hands-on applications with code examples, simulations, and/or real-world implementations. Theory is only acceptable when immediately followed by practical exercises. Students must be able to apply knowledge to control humanoid robots in simulated and real-world environments after completing each module.

### IV. Progressive Learning Architecture
Content must follow a logical progression from basic AI concepts to advanced Physical AI implementations. Each module builds upon previous knowledge with clear prerequisites stated. Weekly breakdowns must be consistent with academic quarter schedules, with appropriate pacing for student comprehension and practical assignment completion.

### V. Documentation & Deployment Standards
All content must be Docusaurus-compatible with proper navigation, cross-referencing, and GitHub Pages deployment capability. Code examples must include setup instructions, dependencies, and troubleshooting guides. Visual elements like diagrams and code snippets must be properly formatted and accessible.

### VI. Assessment & Learning Outcomes Alignment
Every module must include measurable learning outcomes, assessment methods, and evaluation criteria. Content must support various assessment types including practical labs, projects, and theoretical understanding. Hardware requirements and lab architecture must be clearly specified for institutional adoption.

## Technical Constraints
All development must utilize Docusaurus for documentation structure with GitHub Pages deployment. Content generation follows Spec-Kit Plus spec-driven methodology with Claude Code assistance. Material must be current as of December 15, 2025, with accurate, up-to-date information on AI/robotics technologies. Code examples must be tested and verified for correctness.

## Educational Methodology
Development workflow must include student accessibility reviews, practical testing of all examples, and peer review by domain experts. Content must undergo validation for educational effectiveness, technical accuracy, and pedagogical soundness. All changes require verification that they enhance learning outcomes without compromising technical rigor.

## Governance
This constitution governs all aspects of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book development. All contributions, changes, and implementations must comply with these principles. Amendments require documentation of pedagogical justification, community review, and approval by project maintainers. All pull requests and reviews must verify constitutional compliance before merging.
